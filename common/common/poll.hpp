// poll.hpp -- waiting by looking again, for a condition no word bump announces.
//
// The futex waits elsewhere in this tree sleep on a word another thread stores to. What is here is
// for the rest: a mutex falling free, a counter reaching a mark, a child changing state. Nobody
// wakes the waiter, so the only wait available is to look, sleep, and look again.
//
// The step is a parameter with no default. A step short enough for a critical section ending is
// wrong for a process starting, and a default is what makes that choice by accident.
