// timing.hpp -- the clock this tree measures with, and the two things it does with one.
//
// A budget that runs out, and a span that is measured after the fact. Kept apart because they are
// asked opposite questions: one is how much is left, the other is how much went by.
//
// Everything here reads the clock through now() and nowhere else, so which clock that is stays one
// line rather than a habit spread over the tree.
//
// Header-only and free of both libraries, so the library, the daemon, the tools and the harness all
// take the same ones, and a wait written in one of them reads the same as a wait written in another.

// The aliases below are this header's surface, and a caller naming Millis is not naming

// every consumer to <chrono> for a type it never spells.
// timespec and timeval are here for the same reason getTicks is: a kernel interface takes a duration
// as its own shape, and every caller converting by hand is every caller getting the remainder wrong.
